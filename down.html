                        <p>
                            Nextdoor is a private social media platform for neighborhoods with the goal of increasing community engagement between neighbors. Two of my colleagues and I were tasked with designing a service expansion on Nextdoor that will allow motivated community members to open their homes to host talks by influential individuals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's also important to note that Nextdoor isn't really our client, this is just a project drafted by our instructors to teach us how to work with a team and with a client who has an existing product.

                <!-- The problem description -->
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    In the brief, our client had laid out a description of four phases that they want accomplished.
                    <h5>The four phases are:</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Initial planning phase (matching hosts and speakers together)</li>
                        <li>Event set-up phase (some sort of invitation, RSVP, and ticket management)</li>
                        <li>Attendance phase (maps and directions to the host's home)</li>
                        <li>On-going follow up phase (for periodically updating related content and hosting a discussion channel)</li>
                    </ol>
                    However, through our research, we discovered that Nextdoor's existing event system has such low exposure and user engagement that it wouldn't be able to support a Speaker Series and that it would hinder the platform. Furthermore, we consulted the stakeholders about the brief and discovered that the goal of the Speaker Series was to increase user engagement and acquisition. So our problem wasn't figuring our how to design a Speaker Series for Nextdoor, but how to increase user engagement and user acquisition on the platform.

                <h3>Solution Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Since we pivoted and redefined the problem, our solution was no longer to design a Speaker Series event system. Instead we ideated on a series of high impact and low cost design changes to the existing platform in order to increase user engagement and acquisition.

                <!-- Our Process -->
                <h3>Our Process</h3>
                <h5>Research</h5>
                <p>
                    Since this was a 2-week project, we didn't have as much time as we would have liked to research. Our goal for the end of the first week was to have our research results synthesized and have some preliminary design ideas. We took the results from our surveys, empathy maps, speedboats, and interviews, and created an affinity map to extrapolate some insights.
                </p>
                <p> By the end of the research synthesis, we had firmly established that there is a need for events on Nextdoor, but a Speaker Series didn’t make sense. Since we didn’t have any real means to contact our client and ask them why they wanted a Speaker Series, we made an assumption that we asked them anyways. The point in doing this was to figure out what the client really wanted out of the Speaker Series. After some time, we decided that Nextdoor’s goal was to increase user engagement and acquisition through increased event engagement.
                </p>

                <h5>Design</h5>
                <p>
                    I wireframed in parallel with one of my teammates. I worked mainly my own sketch designs, but we got together to establish a style guideline that we should follow shortly afterwards. During the final stages, I finalized all designs to make sure that they had the same design styles to enforce that they are all part of the same application.
                </p>

                <h5>Testing</h5>
                <p>
                    To verify some of the issues we are fixing for, I ran usability tests on Nextdoor's mobile application with 3 of my colleagues. My test consisted of 3 tasks:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Explore the app</li>
                        <li>Find an event</li>
                        <li>Create an event</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                    From the exploration step, none of them explored to the event screen. When prompted to find an event, they were eventually able to find one, but it was not on their first try. Finally, when asked to create an event, none of the users created one through the compose button. One of the users showed discontent with the requirement to invite entire neighborhoods, and another could not figure out how to set a location properly.

                <!-- Results -->
                <h3>Results & Reflections</h3>
                <p>
                    I learned that what the client wants may not actually be what they need. In our case, Nextdoor wasn't ready for a Speaker Series, and I think that it was important to inform our clients if the project they want done doesn’t help them achieve their goals.
